LinkedIn Compliance and Best Practices

Respect Platform Limits
LinkedIn limits connection requests to prevent spam. Stay within 100-150 requests per week, and avoid aggressive automation that violates terms of service.

Avoid Spam Behavior
Never send identical messages to multiple people, avoid overly salesy language in first contact, provide value before asking for anything, and respect unresponsiveness.

Maintain Profile Authenticity
Keep all profile information truthful and accurate, don't misrepresent experience or credentials, use real professional photos, and maintain professional standards.

Honor Privacy and Preferences
Respect when people decline connections, don't repeatedly message unresponsive contacts, honor unsubscribe requests, and maintain professional boundaries.

Follow LinkedIn Terms of Service
Review and comply with LinkedIn's user agreement, avoid prohibited practices like fake profiles or automation abuse, and protect account longevity through compliance.
