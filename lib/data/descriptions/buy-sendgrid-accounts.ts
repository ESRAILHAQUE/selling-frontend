Best Practices for SendGrid Success

Warm Up Your Account Gradually
Even with pre-verified accounts, gradually increase sending volume over the first week. Start with 10-20% of your target volume and increase daily to build optimal sender reputation.

Maintain Clean Email Lists
Regularly remove invalid addresses, honor unsubscribes promptly, segment engaged vs. unengaged subscribers, and avoid purchased or scraped email lists to maintain deliverability.

Implement Proper Authentication
Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are properly configured for your sending domains. Use custom domains rather than generic ones for better branding and deliverability.

Monitor Deliverability Metrics
Track bounce rates, spam complaints, unsubscribe rates, and engagement metrics. Investigate issues quickly and adjust strategies based on data.

Create Valuable Email Content
Send emails that provide genuine value to recipients. Avoid spam trigger words, maintain appropriate text-to-image ratios, include clear unsubscribe links, and respect recipient preferences.

Segment Your Audience
Send targeted emails to specific audience segments based on interests, behavior, demographics, or engagement level rather than batch-and-blast approaches.

Test Before Sending
Use A/B testing for subject lines and content, preview emails across devices and clients, check spam scores, and send test emails before launching campaigns.

Comply with Email Regulations
Follow CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CASL, and other email regulations. Include physical addresses, honor opt-outs within 10 days, obtain proper consent, and maintain clear privacy policies.
