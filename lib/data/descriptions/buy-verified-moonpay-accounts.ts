Best Practices for MoonPay Account Success

Secure Your Account Immediately
Upon receiving your MoonPay account, log in through the official website or mobile app, change the password to a strong unique passphrase, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), add your personal email for notifications, verify account settings, and review security features.

Link Your Payment Methods
Add your credit/debit cards or bank account information to your MoonPay account. Start with one payment method to test the process, verify the linkage successfully, then add additional payment methods for backup and flexibility. Multiple payment methods provide options if one declines.

Start With Small Test Purchases
Before making large transactions, conduct a small test purchase ($50-$100) to familiarize yourself with the process, verify crypto delivery to your wallet, confirm fees and exchange rates, ensure everything works correctly, and build confidence before larger transactions.

Choose Optimal Payment Methods
Credit/debit cards offer instant processing but higher fees (3-4.5%), making them ideal for urgent purchases and smaller amounts. Bank transfers have lower fees (1-2%) but slower processing (1-3 days), making them better for larger purchases where timing is less critical. Choose strategically based on amount and urgency.

Monitor Exchange Rates and Fees
MoonPay displays total costs including fees before transaction confirmation. Compare total cost to market spot price, understand fee structures, monitor exchange rates for favorable timing, and make informed decisions about purchase timing and payment methods.

Use Proper Wallet Addresses
Always triple-check wallet addresses before confirming purchases. Send to addresses you control, verify network selection (Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Lightning, Ethereum vs Polygon), use address book features for frequently used addresses, and confirm receipt before making additional purchases.

Keep Transaction Records
Maintain detailed records of all MoonPay purchases including purchase amounts, cryptocurrencies received, exchange rates, fees paid, transaction dates, and wallet addresses. Proper documentation ensures accurate tax reporting and financial record-keeping.

Take Advantage of Wallet Integration
If you use MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Ledger Live, or other integrated wallets, purchase directly through the wallet interface for seamless experience, automatic address filling, simplified process, and integrated transaction history.
